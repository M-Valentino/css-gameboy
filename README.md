# CSS Game Boy V2
The original code was made by [Martin Gauer](https://github.com/attackemartin/css-gameboy) which was 100% pure HTML and CSS. I added JavaScript so that the power button can be toggled on and off. Additionally I added the scrolling Nintendo logo to the screen when powered on.

## Made out of HTML and CSS
The visuals of the Game Boy are made out of HTML and CSS. There are no `<img>` elements.

## Demo
https://codepen.io/m-valentino/pen/KKjRJMm
Codepen disables reloading the window, so turning the gameboy on and off again won't work (this is needed in order to reset the Nintendo logo gif that loops only once). Clone the repo for the best expirience.

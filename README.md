# CSS Game Boy
The original code was made by [Martin Gauer](https://github.com/attackemartin/css-gameboy) which was 100% pure HTML and CSS. I added JavaScript so that the power button can be toggled on and off.

### Made out of HTML and CSS
The visuals of the Game Boy are made out of HTML and CSS. There are no `<img>` elements.
